# Network Analysis Report
## DevOps Networking Lab

### Executive Summary
This report documents network analysis performed using both Windows Power shell and CMD 

## Tools used 
1. **Windows PowerShell** : Advanced scripting environment
2. **Windows CMD** : native command prompt
3. **Network Utilities** : ping , netstat, nslookup, traceroute

### key finding
- Successfully demonstrated cross-platform networking commands
- Git Bash allows Linux commands on Windows systems
- Windows and Linux have equicalent utilities with different syntax
- Network diagnostics follow similar principle across platforms

### Screenshots Captured
1. `ip addr show`vs `ipconfig` comparison
2. `ping` command output
3. `netstat`/`ss` port listings
4. DNS resolution with `nslookup`
5. Route tracing with `traceroute`/`tracert`

## Recommendations
1. use Git Bash for consistent command syntax across platforms
2. Doocument command equivalents for team refernece
3. Create wrapper scripts for common diagnostics
4. Regular network baseline documentation
